After the VScode open, we can see there are some folders. Lets check these folders individually.

**public -** here we can put public assets like font families or images.. etc..
**src -** 
assets -  this is also very similar folder to public folder, where we can store assets.
App.css - 
App.jsx - 
index.css - 
main.jsx - 
**.eslintrc.cjs -** 
**.gitignore -** 
**index.html -** 
**package.json -** 
**README.md -** 
**vite.config.js -** 



So basically how react works in general, is we write react code and it covert to HMTL and it is get rendered inside the  <====div> id="root"></div==>


React Component Tree isÂ **an interactive hierarchical dependency tree that lives directly within your VS Code IDE**. Simply select a component file as the project root, and React Component Tree will build a full component tree and retrieve information about available props at any level.

so we can visit the source directory in our application and make component folder. Later we can create some components.

for this project can remove app.css. we dont need it for this project. 
Best thing about jsx is we can write JavaScript inside html. we dont need to write JavaScript separately and call them in html.

---

So now we need three components for this project.

TodoCard.jsx
TodoInput.jsx
TodoList.jsx
