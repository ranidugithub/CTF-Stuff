In industry, a shell refers to an interface that allows users to interact with a Unix or Linux system. When you enter commands, you're interacting with the shell, which interprets these commands and executes them, returning the output. For example, using the `ls` command in the terminal lists the contents of the current directory.

People use the shell because it's an efficient tool for server management and automation. By writing scripts, you can automate repetitive tasks and streamline processes. In Unix and Linux systems, there are several types of shells available. The default shell in most Linux systems is Bash, but you can check your current shell by typing `echo $SHELL` in the terminal. This will display the shell you're using.

If you're using Bash, you can type `/usr/bin/bash` to confirm your shell, and the previous command (`echo $SHELL`) will confirm this.

A Bash script is a simple text file containing one or more commands. When you execute the script, the commands within it are executed sequentially. Let's create a simple Bash script using the `ls` command:

1. Open a new file called `testscript.sh` using a text editor like `nano`:

    `nano testscript.sh`
    
2. Inside the file, type the `ls` command and save the file:
    
    `ls`
    
3. Make the script executable by using the `chmod +x` command:
    
    `chmod +x testscript.sh`

If the script file name appears in green when you list files (the color may vary depending on your Linux distribution, such as Kali Linux), it means the file is executable. You can also use the `ls -l` command to check the file's permissions.

4. Run the script by typing `./testscript.sh` in the terminal:
    
    `./testscript.sh`

This will execute the `ls` command within the script and display the contents of the current directory.

  
When writing Bash scripts, it's not mandatory to use the `.sh` extension, but it's considered good practice for clarity and consistency. The first line of a properly written Bash script should begin with the shebang (`#!/bin/bash`), indicating the interpreter the script should use. This line specifies that the script is to be executed by the Bash shell.

Even if the script doesn't have the `.sh` extension, the presence of the shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) at the top of the script indicates that it is a Bash script. This allows the system to recognize and execute the script correctly as a Bash script.

lets do a simple hello world example

A simple "Hello World!" example in Bash script involves using the `echo` command to print the string "Hello World!" to the terminal.
