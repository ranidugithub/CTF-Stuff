## **Bash - Bourne-again shell**

Bash scripting is a convenient way to automate tasks on Linux systems. As Linux administrators and DevOps professionals, we often perform repetitive tasks that require running multiple commands. Instead of executing these commands manually each time, we can use bash scripting to automate the process. Bash scripts allow us to save a series of commands in a file and execute them as needed, making our workflow more efficient and consistent.

bash is a command interpreter or a shell that we use in linux/inux system.
A command interpreter isÂ a type of program that reads lines of text entered by a user and executes them to the operating system.
