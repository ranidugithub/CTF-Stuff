What are datatypes in C# programming?

In C#, data types are classifications that specify the type of data a variable can hold. They determine what kind of operations can be performed on the data and how much memory is required.

lets check the below example:

1. Defines a namespace and a class with an entry point (`Main` method).
2. Declares an integer variable `age` and assigns it the value `23`.
3. Prints the value of `age` to the console.
4. Waits for the user to press Enter before closing.
