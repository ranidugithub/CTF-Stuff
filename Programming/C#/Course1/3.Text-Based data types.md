Now we can make a string variable and name that "==test=="

When we declaring string values we need to put the values in speech marks.
but when you declare char values we use single quotation marks.

here we have declare string and char variables and give values for them.

if you single quotation marks it refers to one single character.
If you see double quotation mark, it can be one or more characters.

some times strings can be empty.
==string name = ""==
This means we storing string but have no value.

but for char it is different. you have to provide a value. variables cannot be empty.
