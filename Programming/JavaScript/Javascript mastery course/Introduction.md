- What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is technology that we to create websites.
we can give instructions for a computer to do/make something.

we can use 3 simple technologies to build websites.

- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript


HTML creates the content of a website.
CSS changes the appearance of a website.
JavaScript makes the website interactive.

like above example we can see opening and closing brackets, single quotation marks. These are called Syntax. if we miss one these Syntax, code will not run and it will show errors. Syntax are the rules of programming.

JavaScript have lots of Syntax rules. we can learn them one by one.


lets do a simple math example in the console.
so here we have given a simple instruction to do a simple 2 + 2 math calculation. and we got 4 as the answer. this how we simple give some instructions to computer and get results.

Now lets use JavaScript to modify the webpage.

lets type ==document.body.innerHTML = 'hello';==

then computer follows our instructions
