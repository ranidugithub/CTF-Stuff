This code creates a square pattern of asterisks (`*`). Here's a simple explanation:

1. **Read Input**: The code first asks the user to input a number (`n`), which determines the size of the square.
    
2. **Outer Loop**: The outer `for` loop runs `n` times, where each iteration represents a row in the square.
    
3. **Inner Loop**: The inner `for` loop also runs `n` times for each iteration of the outer loop, where each iteration represents a column in that row.
    
4. **Print Asterisks**: Inside the inner loop, an asterisk (`*`) is printed followed by a space, without moving to the next line (due to `end=' '`).
    
5. **New Line**: After the inner loop finishes (a complete row is printed), `print()` is called to move to the next line, starting a new row.
    

In summary, the code prints an `n x n` square of asterisks.
