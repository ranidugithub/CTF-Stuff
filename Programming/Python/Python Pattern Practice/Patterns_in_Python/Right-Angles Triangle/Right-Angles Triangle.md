This code creates a right-angled triangle pattern of asterisks (`*`). Here's a simple explanation:

1. **Read Input**: The code first asks the user to input a number (`n`), which determines the height of the triangle.
    
2. **Outer Loop**: The outer `for` loop runs `n` times, where each iteration represents a row in the triangle.
    
3. **Inner Loop**: The inner `for` loop runs `r + 1` times for each iteration of the outer loop, where `r` is the current row number. This means the number of asterisks in each row increases as you go down the rows (starting from 1 asterisk in the first row, 2 in the second, and so on).
    
4. **Print Asterisks**: Inside the inner loop, an asterisk (`*`) is printed followed by a space, without moving to the next line (due to `end=' '`).
    
5. **New Line**: After the inner loop finishes (a complete row is printed), `print()` is called to move to the next line, starting a new row.
