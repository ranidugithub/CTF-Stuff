It is a way of organizing and writing code that makes it easier to understand, manage and reuse.

Objects are self-contained blocks of codes with their own properties and functions.

Objects are like building blocks that can be used to create more complex programs.

Encapsulation  in OOP means hiding internal details of objects from the outside, making it easier to manage and understand code.

Inheritance allows for the creation of classes(blueprints) that can create multiple objects with shared properties and methods.
