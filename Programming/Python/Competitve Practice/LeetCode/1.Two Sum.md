There are some topics needed to understand before jump into Leetcode questions.





So what is Hashmap?




So what is Big o Notation?

A way to describe, how long algorithm performs as its input size grows.

As the way we input more inputs, or data points to Algorithm. There are two things might grow in complexity.

It may take longer to run algorithm, which we call  - **time complexity.**
or
may require more memory, which we call - **space complexity.**

The variable **N** represents the number of inputs.

Imagine variable N been scaled up to higher number. The faster the results grows in each steps, the worse algorithm performs.
Time and space complexity of algorithm is a very important thing to consider.
