The "Publisher" CTF machine is a simulated environment hosting some services. Through a series of enumeration techniques, including directory fuzzing and version identification, a vulnerability is discovered, allowing for Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attempts to escalate privileges using a custom binary are hindered by restricted access to critical system files and directories, necessitating a deeper exploration into the system's security profile to ultimately exploit a loophole that enables the execution of an unconfined bash shell and achieve privilege escalation.

first lets perform a simple Nmap scan.

this shows port 80 and port 20 is open.

lets check port 80, and show a website. And there is something called SPIP
_SPIP_Â is a free software content management system designed for web site publishing, oriented towards online collaborative editing.

then I checked for some SPIP vulnerability and found a good git repository explaining a attack on SPIP.


in a part is shows the possibility in injection of serialized PHP string,

if we go forward with SPIP, we redirecting to another page.

and if we click the first link, we ll be sent to another page.

then as per the instruction, if we put page=spip_pass, we ll be redirected to the below page

we can use open burpsuite, listen and enter a random email in the box.

now we have to add remaining parts as explained in the website.

then we can forward the traffic and we got another page which has information related to php.

lets search for a php injection method using metasploit
![](../../../../../Pasted%20image%2020240810135914.png)

we found one remote code execution method.
we can use 1 and set all the required information
![](../../../../../Pasted%20image%2020240810140240.png)

and we successfully able to spawn a shell.

since we can read the id_rsa file, we can copy create id_rsa file in our kali machine.

![](../../../../../Pasted%20image%2020240810141045.png)



so using this id_rsa we can easily login to think user

i tried to add linpeas to the tmp directory. got an user permission error.
![](../../../../../Pasted%20image%2020240810142331.png)

then searching hints given in root flag. found a location where we can send linpeas.(/dev/shm)
![](../../../../../Pasted%20image%2020240810142651.png)
i get to know i was not in bash, so i changed to bash and checked the  opt folder.
![](../../../../../Pasted%20image%2020240810144116.png)

and found a docker container
